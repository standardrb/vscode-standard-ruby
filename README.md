# vscode-standard-ruby

This is the official VS Code extension for [Standard
Ruby](https://github.com/testdouble/standard), maintained by your friends at
[Test Double](https://testdouble.com).

If you want to lint and format your Ruby in VS Code with Standard, you can
either use this bespoke extension or [configure Ruby LSP to use our built-in
Ruby LSP
add-on](https://github.com/standardrb/standard/wiki/IDE:-vscode#using-ruby-lsp),
which additionally offers Quick Fixes via [Code Action
support](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#textDocument_codeAction).

If you choose to use this extension, you can install it from the [Visual Studio
Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=testdouble.vscode-standard-ruby).

## Language Server Capabilities

These are the capabilities of this extension, each enabled by Standard's [built-in LSP server](https://github.com/testdouble/standard#language-server-protocol-support):

| Capability  | Support |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Diagnostics (Linting) | ‚úÖ |
| Document Formatting  | ‚úÖ |
| Execute Command ([Trigger autofix](https://github.com/testdouble/vscode-standard-ruby#manually-triggering-a-format-with-automatic-fixes)) | ‚úÖ |
| Everything else  | ‚ùå  |

## Requirements

* Version 1.24.3 of the [standard
gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/standard)
* Version 1.75.0 of [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) or higher

## Configuration

The extension only offers a few of its own configuration options, but because it
conforms to the [VS Code Formatting
API](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2016/11/15/formatters-best-practices#_the-formatting-api),
several general editor settings can impact the extension's behavior as well.

## General editor settings

There are two general editor settings that you'll want to verify are set in
order to use Standard Ruby as your formatter.

### editor.defaultFormatter

First, if you want the extension to format your Ruby files, you need to specify
Standard as your formatter of choice by setting `editor.defaultFormatter` under
a `"[ruby]"` section of `settings.json` like this:

```json
"[ruby]": {
  "editor.defaultFormatter": "testdouble.vscode-standard-ruby"
},
```

### editor.formatOnSave

To automatically apply fixes to your Ruby with Standard Ruby, check **Format on
Save** in the **Formatting** settings under **Text Editor**:

![Format a file on save. A formatter must be available, the file must not be saved after delay, and the editor must not be shutting down.](/docs/format-on-save.png)

Or, in `settings.json`:

```json
"editor.formatOnSave": true,
```

## Extension-specific settings

To edit Standard Ruby's own options, first expand **Extensions** and select
**Standard Ruby** from the sidebar of the Settings editor.

### standardRuby.mode

The Mode setting determines how (and whether) Standard Ruby runs in a given
workspace. Generally, it will try to execute `standardrb` via `bundle exec` if
possible, and fall back on searching for a global `standardrb` bin in your
`PATH`.

![Enable Standard Ruby via the workspace's Gemfile or else fall back on a global installation unless a Gemfile is present and its bundle does not include standard](/docs/mode.png)

* _"Always run‚Äîwhether via Bundler or globally"_ (JSON: `enableUnconditionally`)
  this mode will first attempt to run via Bundler, but if that fails for any
  reason, it will attempt to run `standardrb` in your PATH
* **[Default]** _"Run unless the bundle excludes standard"_ (JSON:
  `enableViaGemfileOrMissingGemfile`) this mode will attempt to run Standard via
  Bundler, but if a bundle exists and the `standard` gem isn't in it (i.e. you're
  working in a project doesn't use Standard), the extension will disable itself.
  If, however, no bundle is present in the workspace, it will fall back on the
  first `standardrb` executable in your PATH
* _"Run only via Bundler, never globally"_ (JSON: `enableViaGemfile`) the same as
  the default `enableViaGemfileOrMissingGemfile`, but will never run
  `standardrb` from your PATH (as a result, single-file windows and workspace
  folders without a Gemfile may never activate the extension)
* _"Run only globally, never via Bundler"_ (JSON: `onlyRunGlobally`) if you want
  to avoid running the bundled version of Standard, this mode will never
  interact with Bundler and will only run `standardrb` on your PATH
* _"Disable the extension"_ (JSON: `disable`) disable the extension entirely

Or, in `settings.json`:

```json
"standardRuby.mode": "enableViaGemfile",
```

### standardRuby.autofix

The auto-fix option does what it says on the tin. if you don't want Standard to
automatically edit your documents on save, you can disable it here:

![Autofix](/docs/autofix.png)

You might want to disable this if you're using Standard to highlight problems
but don't want it to edit your files automatically. You could also accomplish
this by disabling `editor.formatOnSave`, but as that's a global setting across
all languages, it's more straightforward to uncheck this extension setting.

Or, in `settings.json`:

```json
"standardRuby.autofix": true,
```

### standardRuby.commandPath

As described above, the extension contains logic to determine which version of
`standardrb` to launch. If you want a specific binary to run instead, you can
set it here.

![Command Path](/docs/command-path.png)

This will override whatever search strategy is set in `standardRuby.mode`
(except for `disable`, in which case the extension will remain disabled).

Or, in `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "standardRuby.commandPath": "${userHome}/.rbenv/shims/standardrb"
}
```

### Changing settings only for a specific project

You may want to apply certain settings to a specific project, which you can do
by configuring them in the [Workspace
scope](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings#_workspace-settings)
as opposed to the global User scope.

![Workspace scope](/docs/workspace.png)

Clicking "Workspace" before changing a setting will save it to
`.vscode/settings.json` inside the root workspace directory and will not affect
the extension's behavior in other workspace folders.

## Manually triggering a format with automatic fixes

In addition to the built-in VS Code Formatting API, you can trigger the
extension to format and auto-fix the current file listing by running
the command "Standard Ruby: Format with Automatic Fixes":

![Autofix command](/docs/autofix-command.png)

This is handy if you don't want to enable format-on-save, already have another
formatter associated with Ruby files, want to format your code _before_ saving,
or just want to bind a shortcut to Standard's formatting action.

To map a keybind to the command, search for it by name in the [Keyboard Shortcuts
editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings#_keyboard-shortcuts-editor):

![Keybinding](/docs/keybind.png)

Or, in `keybindings.json`:

```json
[
  {
    "key": "ctrl+alt+cmd+f",
    "command": "standardRuby.formatAutoFixes"
  }
]
```

## Decoding the Status Bar item

The extension also includes a status bar item to convey the status of the
current file listing at a glance.

When the file conforms to Standard without issue:

![Status: no issues](/docs/status-ok.png)

When the file contains a low-severity formatting issue:

![Status: info](/docs/status-info.png)

When the file contains a normal linter error:

![Status: info](/docs/status-warn.png)

When the file fails to parse at all:

![Status: parse failure](/docs/status-parse-fail.png)

Clicking the status bar item will open the problems tab:

![Problems tab](/docs/problems.png)

## Limitations

There's some room for improvement yet, but it isn't yet clear whether these
limitations will be a big deal in practice:

* The extension will only launch a single instance of `standardrb --lsp` per
  workspace. If you're using a [multi-root
  workspace](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/multi-root-workspaces),
  they'll all be handled by whatever Standard version is found in the first one
* Standard's LSP only supports "Full" [text document
  synchronization](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#textDocument_synchronization),
  both because it seemed hard to implement incremental sync correctly and
  because attempting to pass RuboCop's runner a partial document would result in
  inconsistent formatting results

## Acknowledgements

This extension's codebase was initially based on [Kevin
Newton](https://github.com/kddnewton)'s
[vscode-syntax-tree](https://github.com/ruby-syntax-tree/vscode-syntax-tree)
extension, which has a similar architecture (VS Code language client
communicating with a long-running Ruby process via STDIO). Thank you, Kevin! üíö
